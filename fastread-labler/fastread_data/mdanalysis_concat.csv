19,319e53c,Summary: patch to resolve issue 43--whitespace is no longer required around the parentheses in selectAtoms strings. In module MDAnalysis/core/Selection.py and class SelectionParser  the method parse(self selectstr) now adds bounding whitespace around the input string so the parser can handle a lack of whitespace. Method __consume_token(self) in the same class has also been streamlined to incorporate the built-in pop() method rather than the more verbose alternative in place. The changes pass the unit test introduced in r456 and the enhancement has been added to the CHANGELOG.,2010-10-03T17:28:45,1.0

89,23a1bb7,Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when writing (PrimitivePDBWriter) (Issue 63  patch by dcaplan) - When I try to read and write PDBs with 4 character resnames used in NAMD/VMD I end up with an improperly formatted PDB file. This is also an issue with segIDs not being written. - I've made a quick patch where I add support for 4 character resnames and change the format string for the output to write the segID. I also added very simple support for better guessing of atom types since the function guess_atom_type was just returning 0. - I'm still not sure about how to deal with the 2 types of format strings for writing PDBs.,2011-03-11T01:52:59,1.0

211,e11b6d2,MDAnalysis now truncates atom numbers when writing .gro files with more than 99 999 atoms  in a manner consistent with genbox in GROMACS 4.6.3. Note that it appears that some GROMACS utilities (i.e.  trjconv) actually write 00000 instead of 0 for the 100 000th atom. Both formats can be read in by MDAnalysis and VMD  and this is (overall) an improvement that allows us to write large .gro files in a workable manner. Fixes #550.,2012-08-04T10:48:25,1.0

232,3ab4202,analysis.align: quick hacks to make it work again - must use an atom selection for the writer (workaround for Issue 49 when writing to a PDB or GRO) - added tol_mass parameter to avoid raising an exception for small mass differences (e.g. when   one structure is defined via a psf and the other via a pdb with atom mass heuristics) - fixed the progress counter (maybe use analysis.util.progress_meter instead?),2011-04-27T20:21:44,1.0
233,97e5ab6,fixed Issue 57: optimized patch and added test case - moved the coordinate check out of the loop and test the whole coordinate array in one   go (better performance but error reporting is worse because we do not report the offending   atom anymore) - remove the opened PDB file before raising the ValueError - added test case (should have had one for PrimitivePDBWriter anyway...),2010-11-03T12:46:17,1.0

241,b97f2ab,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,2017-07-02 22:46:35,1.0

245,9ecb534,fixed: PDB writer would fail if atom type was an integer - use new guess_atom_element() which right now just does the same as guess_atom_type()   to always guess the element from the atomname - improved guess_atom_type() by also checking for names that start with numbers   such as some hydrogen atoms,2011-03-21T18:12:57,1.0
246,Feb0722,updated a number of examples - write figures to ./figures subdirectory - write data to ./output - added example output and figures for blocks.py  backbone_dihedrals.py    radial_distribution_function.py - fixed/update a number of examples   - blocks.py: block averaging (see example in the paper)   - radial_distribution_function.py: g(r)  this is the optimized version     (see paper) with correct normalisation   - backbone_dihedral.py: example for Timeseries.Collection and use of the     new special Residue.phi_selection() and Residue.psi_selection() methods     for the common backbone dihedrals  script is now ran on the DIMS AdK     trajectory and produces a figure   - TODO: other scripts - made all scripts executable,2013-08-22T19:11:43,1.0

252,ff0e5d0,Distance selections: - AROUND and POINT work when applied to a universe (there's still a   bug present that prevents proper use with AtomGroups)  I fixed a bug   that made these selections spit out total garbage or crash - AROUND uses by default KDTree neighbor search and is about 7x faster   than the distance matrix based routine (still  it is even better to   explicitly construct such selections with AtomGroups and   KDTree.NeighborSearch.AtomNeighborSearch),7/8/14 19:58,1.0
253,1adeb82,FIXED Issue 47 (attribute residue selection from segname now always returns a ResidueGroup) - changes old undocumented behaviour and MIGHT BREAK CODE - also documented the Segment.r<resid> selection but made it 1-based   (makes more sense from the user point of view as all structures/topologies start   numbering at 1 and not at 0 - updated CHANGELOG - tests pass (including the one for Issue 47),2011-04-17T19:36:26,1.0

1141,2793519.0,New: selection can write snapshot to a pdb file (EXPERIMENTAL) - added a simple PDB writer that does not require Bio.PDB (should rewrite PDBWriter) - added core.util for helper functions like filename mangling - small steps towards a unified trajectory API:   . universe.trajectory points to the reader object   . coord.__init__ advertises readers  writers in dicts,2017-03-20T15:15:30,0.0

3199,8fdeab5,MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines_3D adjusted in the following ways: -the assessment of proper grid cube geometries is now less sensitive to floating point equality failure (assertion is now from numpy.testing.assert_almost_equal rather than a conventional equality test) -print statements for debug / progress monitoring have been suppressed (mostly deleted from source code) -the generate_streamlines_3d() function now accepts x y z Cartesian coordinate limits for the analysis instead of automatically calculating the limits of the system  this change is largely motivated by increased consistency with the 2D version of the code in MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines.generate_streamlines(),12/2/14 23:23,0.0

3204,b2bdb24,MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines adjusted in the following ways: -an ImportError with appropriate message should now be raised when a non-standard dependency of this module is not available (rather than a print statement only) -the only non-standard (i.e.  outside of regular MDAnalysis) module requirement has been simplified to matplotlib.nxutils  and ideally this requirement will eventually be removed because it is a deprecated module of matplotlib (and also an analytical rather than plotting use of matplotlib) -the standard dependencies (MDAnalysis  multiprocessing  numpy  scipy) are now imported in separate statements for improved dependency sanity -a substantial amount of extraneous debugging code has been removed (although a bit more clean-up could likely still be done) -the placeholder main() function has been renamed to generate_streamlines() and the workflow may eventually be adjusted (perhaps encapsulated in a class),11/21/14 11:43,0.0
