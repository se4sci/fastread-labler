368,0f7d15d,Added Jacobi quadrature rules. These rules allow for conical product quadrature to be performed on tris and tets.  Although these types of rules are non-optimal (use more points than necessary and cluster points) they are correct  and easy to construct for high orders.  At this time  if you select anything beyond fifth-order quadrature for tets or tris you will get a conical product Gauss-Jacobi rule.  Other changes include fixing a broken 7 point Gauss quadrature rule which had the wrong weights  and making a few functions in the QBase class virtual instead of pure virtual.  This way you can create concrete quadrature classes without implementing anything for 2 and 3D.  The init_1D function is still pure virtual so you will at least need to define 1D quadrature rules if you create a new class.,2003-02-06T06:02:42,1

From his email: ""The major change is related to a scaling introduced to improve the condition number on small and big elements (small and big compared to the reference element). With such a scaling on linear hexs the XYZ is equivalent to a MONOMIAL basis  independently of the element size. On curved elements the approximation properties of this scaled XYZ should be better than MONOMIAL and should allow to go up to a third or fourth degree approximation without any trouble."" Also added miscellaneous_ex8 which is a copy of misellaneous_ex5  but uses XYZ elements instead of MONOMIAL elements. Tested successfully in 2D and 3D.",2012-07-14T03:00:48,1

Reduced   mem requirements for the adjacent_vertices matrices of all higher-order   elements through converting to short int - reduced # of virtual fn's in Elem by one: the higher_order_equiv_elem()   or so got moved into a static member function of Elem.  This also enables   to choose whether one wants to convert quad4->quad8 or quad4->quad9   through a simple bool option in MeshBase::all_second_order(bool) - reduced repeated code in adjacent_vertices through moving these short   int matrices to Hex  Quad  Prism etc - fixed GMV support for higher-order Prisms (enuff debugging for today...  -),2003-08-18T14:44:52,1

482,d5803b5,constructor was moved from the header file  but was still inline.  xlC (correctly?) does not provide global linkage  resulting in a linker error.  Fixed.,2005-09-30 15:03:06,1

489,7dda254,- extended the MeshData to compatible mode: when the  MeshData   was not active at mesh import time  one can still write   a Universal mesh  or read/write mesh data through the   compatibility mode.  However  be cautious with this mode    it uses the _current_ Mesh node and element ids - fixed MeshBase Universal support for Tet10,2003-08-08T14:11:27,1
490,1b05f5a,- Added the embedding matrices for the Prism18. - Fixed the ambiguous definition of the Prism reference element...   For the record  it is (xi eta) in the standard reference isoscolese   triangle with zeta in [0 1]  NOT [-1 1].  Sorry about the confusion.   It was wrong in two places in such a way that they cancelled each other   out! - Creating the boundary mesh works again  this time without renumbering the   nodes,2003-02-26T01:08:14,1

507,8eab73b,- added _build_ support for 2D infinite elements - fixed nodal_soln for infinite elements - added static member libMesh::zero.  May not be really necessary    but want to be on the safe side: who knows what the default   constructor of std::complex does with only one double passed in. - added container class FEComputeData.  Serves as a hide for   I/O to customized FE classes.  E.g. for the notorious infinite   elements  the compute_data()  using FEComputeData  is the physically   correct counterpart to shape(),2003-04-03 14:17:25,1
508,084451d,Fixed element normal calculations for 2D elements living in 3D.  The normal vector now lies in the tangent plane of the element rather than arbitrarily in the x-y plane.,2006-12-07 21:46:31,1

1777,92adec8,- reworked the MeshUnvInterface internals:  no need for a /tmp/xyz file   any more that buffers data.  This new method is something like   20%+ faster than the old one.  Tested on linux and hp-ux - added typedefs MeshData::const_node_data_iterator and   MeshData::const_node_data_iterator similar to the iterators for   the elements and nodes in MeshBase.  Convenient when one wants to   iterate directly over the nodes/elements with associated data  e.g.   Dirichlet-type boundary conditions.  Tested on linux and hp-ux,2003-09-09T14:11:56,0

We could rewrite it  but for now it seems simpler to just do a redistribute() (if applicable - making it a MeshBase virtual decides that) immediately after element repartitioning.  redistribute() and gather_neighboring_elements() don't depend on node processor_ids being correct yet.,2012-06-03T03:41:53,0

2005,ccea24d,The _elements and _nodes std::vectors have been moved from MeshBase to Mesh at long last.  There are still several lingering design issues which will have to be addressed when additional Mesh subclasses are actually created.  MeshBase now contains a great deal of pure virtual functions which have to be reimplemented in derived classes.  I am certain not all of them will make sense for every subclass  so we will probably end up with another level of abstraction like UnstructuredMesh and then the actual Mesh class.  For now some additional clean-up is probably required  but the examples are running correctly.

But use PointLocatorList with CAUTION!  since this is primarily intended for locating the closest element  where the point may live in 3D  and the element  too  but the element is actually 2D (surface).  When applied to volumetric meshes (which is not truly intended)  it may happen that the centroid of an adjacent element is closer due to extremely distorted elements,2003-07-05T14:58:59,0

It differs from normal iterators in that op++ automatically advances the iterator to the next item in the container which satisfies the user-supplied predicate.  From the abstract PredicatedIterator base class  several concrete classes have already been defined.  They are currently used in the MeshBase class to iterate over the _elements vector.

5987,0efbaea,The partitioners now set a new variable in the Mesh called _n_parts.  This variable was needed since n_subdomains does not map directly to the number of partitions created when using partitioners  and neither does n_processors() since you may partition a mesh on one processor if you wish.  Therefore the partitioners all set the new variable _n_parts in the mesh to allow for this possibility.  The GMV routine now allows you to plot (without error messages) the different partitions of the grid.,2004-05-11 20:29:07,0

6001,3b5cc78,Added operator << functions to all the classes which had print_info() members.  Now you can do: Mesh mesh(2)  std::cout << mesh << std::endl  That is equivalent to: Mesh mesh(2)  mesh.print_info() ,2004-04-18 00:51:51,0
6002,2b0278e,Added support for some methods of TetGen 1.3 library. To make use of the functionality added  the environment variable TETGEN_DIR must be defined and libMesh must be configured with option --enable-tetgen.

6054,4859f74,Reworked the tecplot_connectivity() and vtk_connectivity() functionality in the Elem class and all subclasses.  They have been combined into one function called connectivity() which should be extensible for new IO packages such as GMSH and DB Explorer without changing the interface of the Elem class. Sorry for the wicked recompile.,2004-07-14 19:23:19,0
6055,60b8fdf,Added enumeration file for IO software packages like Tecplot  GMV  etc.,2004-07-14 19:26:06,0
6056,a69c50d,More changes for the connectivity routines in the Elem class. Now there are no longer separate functions for write_ucd_connectivity and write_tecplot_connectivity. They have been combined in the more generic write_connectivity routine.,2004-07-22 19:54:17,0

6070,0facff4,Added new USER_PRECOND type,2004-08-20 13:56:27,0
6071,ebcef0b,cleaned up the trees a bit and added an option to create a tree from the elements directly  bypassing the nodes.  The obvious extension (that I have not made yet) will use the trees (and PointLocators) to find not only elements but also nodes.  Incidentally  the motivation for this was reading a structured surface mesh with a singular axis that contained a number of points at the same physical location in space.  When the target bin size for the tree was less than the number of coincident points an infinite loop was created...  Charming.,2004-03-22 22:41:46,0
6072,0cb82fa,Made a few methods in MeshCommunication const and introduced the first use of the mutable keyword in the library to allow the operator() method of the point_locator_* classes to be const.

6083,2e4be07,If we read system data from a file that has fewer variables than our current system  let's remap that data onto our own variables of the same name.  This enables physics-upgrading restarts.,2011-04-08T22:44:43,0
6084,23ff717,Major rbOOmit revision: removed the function-pointer based assembly and replaced it with object-based assembly via RBTheta and ElemAssembly. This approach is much more flexible. Made corresponding changes in ex23.,2011-04-10T20:52:31,0

6104,5d3d53e,Modified the write_offline_data_to_files and read_offline_data_from_files methods in rbOOmit. They now take an extra argument (with default value ALL_DATA) that indicates whether we should write out all the data  or just the basis function (in)dependent subset. Also  the greedy_params vector has been moved from RBSystem to RBEvaluation since each basis is generated with a different set of greedy parameters in general.,2011-03-22T16:23:33,0

6229,3276f53,moved MeshBase::contract() up to Mesh.  Unfortunately  there is no good way to make MeshBase::delete_elem() efficient  so the old implementation of MeshBase::contract() was (potentially) O(n_elem^2)  and consumed approximately 20 percent of the runtime in ex10.  This new implementation exploits the fact that the elements are stored in a vector (which is why it was moved up to the Mesh class) and is linear in the number of elements.  The new implementation is less that 1 percent of the run time in ex10.,2005-05-08 14:11:17,0
6230,22326a6,Finally implemented the EigenSystem and an interface to the SLEPc eigen solvers. Also include an example ex16 to show how to use the new feature. SLEPc support makes only sense in combination with the corresponding PETSc version. Hence cofigure checks if both PETSc and SLEPc have the same version numbers. The Interface may only work for the latest SLEPc currently available (2.2.1).,2005-05-02 13:12:29,0

8328,bfeabec,Slew of header file interdependency reduction. Warning: you may have to include more header files in your user code due to the removal of many unnecessary prior inclusions.,2005-06-11 03:59:18,0
8329,3b70312,Reducing header file dependences.  Instead of having a BoundaryInfo object in the MeshBase  we now have an AutoPtr<BoundaryInfo>.  This maintains the same level of safety with regard to garbage collection and removes the boundary_info.h dependency from mesh_base.h. If you have any code which used the mesh.boundary_info.xxx() syntax  you will have to change it to mesh.boundary_info->xxx().  The same idea was used in system.h to hold an AutoPtr<DofMap> rather than a naked pointer.,2005-06-11 05:11:31,0
